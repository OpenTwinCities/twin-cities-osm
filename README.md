# Twin Cities OpenStreetMap Mini Site

A mini site focused on getting folks editing OpenStreetMap for the Twin Cities as quickly as possible.

## iD Editor

This site is using the (currently in Alpha) iD Editor.  Any hacks or issues should be documented here:

* iD expects images in the root ```/img/``` so there is a copy of the images there.
