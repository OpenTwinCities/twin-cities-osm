# Twin Cities OpenStreetMap Mini Site

A mini site focused on getting folks editing OpenStreetMap for the Twin Cities as quickly as possible.

## iD Editor

This site is using the (currently in Alpha) iD Editor.  The goal of the site is to make the content and context specific to the Twin Cities to help with editing.  This means updating/overriding content of the iD editor as well as some of its code.

* iD expects images in the root ```/img/``` so there is a copy of the images there.
* Specific files are overrided in ```/js/id-override/```.
